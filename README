Uva Core is a toolkit to help you develop applications using the Schools Interoperability Framework (SIF). You can find out more about SIF here: www.sifinfo.org

Using it:
---------

All you need to build you own application using Uva Core is its main library file found under jar/uva-core.jar as well as all of its dependencies under lib/*

Building it:
------------

In order to build Uva Core you will need:
	
	- Ant (from the apache foundation)
	- JDK 1.5 or later

Just type "ant" in the root directory and the main jar will be built


The directories contain sample agents that you can use as the base for the development of your own products. 

How to build/run the examples:
-----------------------------

All the examples are meant to be compiled from inside the uva core source structure since they reference shared libraries in lib/ as well as uva-core.jar itself. 

Running the example is really simple, just cd in the example agent you want and type: ant run
